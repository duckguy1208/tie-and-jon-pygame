# TODO

## Defects

- [ ] Platforms always need to be within reach of the duck's max jump height. No impossible platforms.

## Features

- [x] procedural generate platforms upward.
- [x] increment score as duck goes upward.
- [ ] parallax background scrolling.
- [x] game over screen when falling off the bottom.

## Tech Debt

- [ ] implement proper linting that enforces python standards. Include the linting as part of a pre commit hook
- [ ] implement automatic code formatting with prettier (or other if there is something more python focused). Add .vscode/settings.json to ensure all devs automtically have formatting on save/paste.
